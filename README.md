# Virtual-Frequency-Meter

Our team learned and created a Virtual Frequency Meter which detects frequency of 
oscillating Electric current using an AVR micro controller ATmega32.
Its virtual model was created on Proteus 8 Professional software, which enable us 
to perform its simulation. While code was written and added through Atmel Studio 7.0 Software.
